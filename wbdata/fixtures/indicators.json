This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States).

Each entry in the country\u00eds schedule is assigned scores based on its relative restrictiveness, using a criteria set out by Bernard Hoekman\u00eds methodology.  That resulted in 1,240 scores, ranging from 0 (unbound or no commitments) to 100 (completely liberalized), with an intermediate value of 50 for partial commitments. A simple average of the subsectoral scores were used to generate aggregate sectoral scores (for the 12 main services sectors as classified by the GATS), modes scores, and market access and national treatment scores. The overall 12 GATS commitment index is a simple average of the sectoral indices.  Disaggregated indices are available for Market Access and National Treatment and for twelve subsectors: business services, communication services, construction and engineering services, distribution services, educational services, environmental services, financial services, health services, tourism services, recreational and cultural services, transport services, and other services.

They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 1999-2001 average international commodity prices and summed for each year.  To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 1999-2001.  Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.  Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities.  They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group \u00eccrops\u00ee and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group \u00eclivestock products\u00ee. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The  \u00eeinternational commodity prices\u00ee are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These\u00ee international prices\u00ee, expressed in so-called\u00eeinternational dollars\u00ee, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single \u00ecprice\u00ee to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country.  Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients.  Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value.  Aggregates are the sum of available data. \nFor some item aggregates, conversion factors are applied to values when calculating totals. Please see item Metadata for the factors at FAOSTAT.

All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 1999-2001 average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 1999-2001.  It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group \u00eccrops\u00ee and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group \u00eclivestock products\u00ee. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The\u00eeinternational commodity prices\u00ee are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These\u00ee international prices\u00ee, expressed in so-called\u00eeinternational dollars\u00ee, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single \u00ecprice\u00ee to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The indices are calculated from production data presented on a calendar year basis.  Aggregates are the sum of available data. \nFor some item aggregates, conversion factors are applied to values when calculating totals. Please see item Metadata for the factors at FAOSTAT.  The FAO indices may differ from those produced by the countries themselves because of differences in concepts of production, coverage, weights, time reference of data and methods of calculation.

The term Autocracy is used and defined operationally in terms of the presence of a distinctive set of political characteristics.  In mature form, autocracies sharply restrict or suppress competitive political participation. Their chief executives are chosen in a regularized process of selection within the political elite, and once in office they exercise power with few institutional constraints. Most modern autocracies also exercise a high degree of directiveness over social and economic activity, but we regard this as a function of political ideology and choice, not a defining property of autocracy. Social democracies also exercise relatively high degrees of directiveness. We prefer to leave open for empirical investigation the question of how Autocracy, Democracy, and directiveness (performance) have covaried over time.\n\nAn eleven-point Autocracy scale is constructed additively.  Operational indicator of autocracy is derived from codings of the competitiveness of political participation using the following weights:\n \nAuthority Coding      Scale Weight\nCompetitiveness of Executive Recruitment (XRCOMP):\n\n(1) Selection     +2\nOpenness of Executive Recruitment (XROPEN):\nonly if XRCOMP is coded Selection (1)\n\n(1) Closed     +1\n(2) Dual/designation    +1\n\nConstraints on Chief Executive (XCONST):\n(1) Unlimited authority    +3\n(2) Intermediate category     +2\n(3) Slight to moderate limitations    +1\n\nRegulation of participation (PARREG):\n(4) Restricted      +2\n(3) Sectarian      +1\n\nCompetitiveness of Participation (PARCOMP):\n(1) Repressed      +2\n(2) Suppressed      +1\n\nThe logic of this \"institutionalized autocracy\" scale is similar to that of the institutionalized democracy scale, below, and it is subject to the same kinds of operational redefinition to suit different theoretical purposes. Note that the two scales do not share any categories in common. Nonetheless many polities have mixed authority traits, and thus can have middling scores on both\nAutocracy and Democracy scales. \n\nPolity IV Project, Political Regime Characteristics and Transitions, 1800-2006, annual, cross-national, time-series and polity-case formats coding democratic and autocratic \"patterns of authority\" and regime changes in all independent countries with total population greater than 500,000 in 2006 (162 countries in 2006; SPSS and Excel data; PDF codebook).

Other aspects of plural democracy, such as the rule of law, systems of checks and balances, freedom of the press, and so on are means to, or specific manifestations of, these general principles. We do not include coded data on civil liberties. \n\nThe Democracy indicator is an additive eleven-point scale (0-10). The operational indicator of democracy is derived from codings of the competitiveness of political participation using the following weights: Polity IV Project: Dataset Users\u00ed Manual 14\n\nAuthority Coding      Scale Weight\nCompetitiveness of Executive Recruitment (XRCOMP):\n(3) Election      +2\n(2) Transitional      +1\n\nOpenness of Executive Recruitment (XROPEN):\nonly if XRCOMP is Election (3) or Transitional (2)\n(3) Dual/election      +1\n(4) Election      +1\n\nConstraint on Chief Executive (XCONST):\n(7) Executive parity or subordination    +4\n(6) Intermediate category     +3\n(5) Substantial limitations     +2\n(4) Intermediate category     +1\n\nCompetitiveness of Political Participation (PARCOMP):\n(5) Competitive     +3\n(4) Transitional      +2\n(3) Factional      +1\n\nThis \"institutional democracy\" indicator follows a logic similar to that underlying the Polity I analyses. There is no \"necessary condition\" for characterizing a political system as democratic, rather democracy is treated as a variable.\n\nPolity IV Project, Political Regime Characteristics and Transitions, 1800-2006, annual, cross-national, time-series and polity-case formats coding democratic and autocratic \"patterns of authority\" and regime changes in all independent countries with total population greater than 500,000 in 2006 (162 countries in 2006; SPSS and Excel data; PDF codebook).

It is intended to provide citizens, legislators, and civil society advocates with the comprehensive and practical information needed to gauge a government\u00eds commitment to budget transparency and accountability. The Open Budget Index 2006 was calculated based on detailed questionnaires completed by local experts in 59 participating countries from every continent.  In 2008, based on inputs received from researchers and extensive in-house reviews, the International Budget Partnership (IBP) has made three changes in the methodology applied to its Open Budget Survey, which is the basis for the Open Budget Index (OBI). The first change concerns the timing of the release of the eight key budget documents assessed by the Survey. The second change is the inclusion of the enacted budget in calculating country scores for the OBI.

(b) Most of the professional staff are appointed by the donor. (c) The salary of PIU personnel often exceeds that of civil-service personnel.\nInterpretation of the survey question on this subject was controversial in a number of countries. It is not clear that within countries all donors applied the same criteria with the same degree of rigour, or that across countries the same standards were used. In a number of cases, the descriptive part of the survey return indicates that some donors applied a legalistic criterion of\naccountability to the formal executing agency, whereas the National Co-ordinator or other donors would have preferred a greater recognition of the substantive reality of accountability to the donor.

Solid fuels include biomass fuels, such as wood, charcoal, crops or other agricultural waste, dung, shrubs and straw, and coal.  \nIn estimating solid fuel use for a given year, the methods developed and implemented by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (WHO & UNICEF 2006 ) were followed. Solid fuel information is either extrapolated (single year data point), averaged (two or more years that are spaced four or fewer years apart) or a linear regression is performed when solid fuel use information is available for two or more years that are spaced at least five years apart.  Limitations of the indicator: (a) The indicator uses solid fuel use as a proxy for indoor air pollution, as it is not currently possible to obtain nationally representative samples of indoor concentrations of criteria pollutants, such as small particles and carbon monoxide. (b) The indicator is based on the main type of fuel used for cooking as cooking occupies the largest share of overall household energy needs. However, many households use more than one type of fuel for cooking and, depending on climatic and geographical conditions, heating with solid fuels can also be a contributor to indoor air pollution levels.
